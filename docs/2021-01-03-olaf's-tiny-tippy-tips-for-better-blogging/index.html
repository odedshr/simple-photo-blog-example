<div class="post_text"><p>First, you can set the post's publication-date by starting the folder's name with a date in the format <code>yyyy-mm-dd</code> (e.g. <code>2020-03-15</code> for the 15th of March, 2020).
It might look a bit weird at first but it makes sense if we want our folders to be ordered chronologically.</p>

<div class="post_text"><p>The second trick is that you can add hashtags at the end of title and they'll appear as such.Hashtags are single words starting with &quot;<code>#</code>&quot; (for example &quot;<code>#cool</code>&quot;).</p>

  </figure>
<div class="post_text"><p>In addition to the image ALT text you can also add a caption, by creating a text (or HTML or MD) with exactly the same name. for example for the photo &quot;<code>hunting.jpg</code>&quot; the caption would be &quot;<code>hunting.jpg.txt</code>&quot;</p>

  <figure class="post_picture">
    <img class="post_image" src="08 Olaf staring at a bird by the window.jpg" alt="Olaf staring at a bird by the window"/><figcaption class="post_image_caption">Thoughts on dinner</figcaption>
  </figure>
<div class="post_text"><p>And lastly, by default the posts are ordered by default in an ascending order (meaning old posts appear at the top) but you can simply reverse the order by updating the &quot;<code>blog-configure.yaml</code>&quot; file setting &quot;<code>order</code>&quot; to &quot;<code>descending</code>&quot;.</p>
