<div class="post_text"><p>Adding text to a post is also very easy. Simply add a text file (with the extension .txt) to the folder and run the upload to compile the new post.Similarly you can add <em>HTML</em> files and <em>MarkDown</em> (.md) files if you want more control of the text's style.</p>
</div>
<div class="post_text">Adding videos is also easy - you can either place your videos in the folder like you did with the photos; <br/></div>

  <video class="post_video" controls>
    <source src="04 Olaf picking the mail.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    üò¢ Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
<div class="post_text">Or if you have the file on a different website (such as vimeo or youtube) you can paste the link in a file with the name ending with ".video.txt" and the video will appear in the post.</div>

<div class="post_text"><br/>The alphabetical order of the files makes a difference as this is the order of the different elements (photos, text and videos) will appear.Photo's filename is used as their ALTernative text, however if the name starts with a number (that is used for ordering) it will be omitted from the image's description.<br/></div>
