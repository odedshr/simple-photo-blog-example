<div class="post_text">This is Olaf.<br/>He is a cat.<br/>Like most cats, Olaf believes he's entitled to his own photo blog;<br/>But this might soundÂ tricky because Olaf doesn't have any thumbs, and he doesn't know anything about web development, but it really isn't.<br/>To Create a new post for his blog, Olaf simply puts all the photos in a folder and double-clicks the upload command and that's it - a new post is available online for Olaf's fans to indulge.</div>
